You have made an impact on Riddle Realty. You have made an impact on the people in our company as well, and for that we are immensely grateful.

We’d like to offer you a token of our appreciation by giving you a pumpkin or apple pie for your Thanksgiving feast.

All you have to do is give us a call at 480-448-2238 or send an email to pie@riddlerealty.com. Let us know if you want pumpkin or apple and we’ll get that ordered for you!

On November 21, the Tuesday before Thanksgiving, stop by our office between 4:00 p.m. and 6:30 p.m. to pick up your pie. We’ll also have cranberry mimosas, mulled wine, pumpkin bars, and other fun munchies for you to enjoy.

Of course, if you need to run in and run out with your pie, that’s fine too.

Again, we are so grateful to you for your support over the years. We would love the opportunity to say hello, give you a hug, and, of course, give you your pie.

As always, if you have any real estate questions, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to seeing you soon!
