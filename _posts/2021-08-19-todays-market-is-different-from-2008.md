Are we in a housing bubble? I haven’t been concerned about this for a while. However, this is something I know a lot of you have been worried about, so let me tell you: We aren’t in a bubble. I have a lot of information to share to back that statement up and calm your nerves a little.

**You can watch my full message above or navigate around using the timestamps provided below for your convenience.**

1:50—When you have a void of information

2:45—Risky loans&nbsp;

3:53—Concerns over the outsized increases

4:51—Mortgage credit availability

5:35—Mortgage, debt, and affordability

6:24—House prices exceeded home-buying power in 2006

7:33—Housing affordability index

I know I threw a lot of graphs and information at you, but hopefully it helps you realize that **today’s market is nothing like 2008’s** when we had the last crash.&nbsp;

Let me know if there’s anything else you want me to cover; I’d be more than happy to make a video over it. There’s even a $25 gift card in it for you if we choose your idea\! Of course, if you want to reach out to me directly with questions, please feel free to call me.
