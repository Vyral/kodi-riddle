<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Today I’m sharing honest facts about COVID-19 and the real estate market.</em></p>

Today I’m providing straight talk about the real estate market and the coronavirus. Whether you want to buy or sell, I’m discussing the facts you need to know. First, we created a booklet called Real Estate and COVID-19 with relevant information, so if you want a copy of it, please let me know; I’ll email it directly to you. We began the pandemic with very low housing inventory, and it’s even lower now because many people have chosen to wait to list their homes due to coronavirus fears. When supply is low and the demand is higher than supply, you’re in a great market to sell. To learn more about our current market, watch the short video above.
