With the power of technology, many people today think that they can sell their homes on their own, skipping the step of hiring a real estate broker. But make no mistake: Technology has made us Realtors better at our jobs, too.

For example, if you try selling your home on your own by using Zillow, your listing will inevitably be inundated with Realtors. But buyers are still going to call a Realtor if they’re interested in your house.

Every property we list has three signs in the yard. Now, the signs themselves aren’t technologically advanced, but they do feature three different phone numbers that lead to different resources:

* **One number is for everyday inquiries about open house times;** calling that number will ring everyone on the team, so the buyer is guaranteed an answer.&nbsp;
* **Another number is for 24/7 information about the property;** calling this number will connect interested parties to a recording detailing the property’s features. Make no mistake: We do track calls to this second number, and we follow up with those inquiries once the client has hung up, or the next day if we don’t catch them.
* The third is a regular real estate sign.

Technology has changed our capacity to find buyers for you. Where we once averaged one call per week, we now average three calls per week.

Zillow is another great example. Realtors spend a lot of money on Zillow for buyer acquisition. Our sellers’ listings go to the top of the search, and our phones are constantly ringing off the hook with calls from buyers asking about the properties. Why? Because we pay for your home’s information to be at the top for this very reason.

On our team, so many dollars are spent on online marketing that it would be really hard for a FSBO seller (For Sale By Owner) or even an average agent who doesn’t have that kind of budget to compete. That’s how we get our sellers more money for their home sales—**technology has allowed us to make our marketing strategies flat-out bigger, better, and stronger.**

Additionally, when buyers search for homes using criteria that your home matches, we have the ability to know when that occurs. If we have your listing, then we’ll make sure that your listing follows that person, appearing as an advertisement on their Facebook feed, for example. I call it ‘Big Brother’ marketing—it’s crazy, it’s cool, and it just works.

We’ve had one heck of a year utilizing these technologies, and we strongly feel that they can serve you, too. If you’d like to go into more detail about real estate technologies, reach out to me. I’d love to share all of the ways that they can help you.
