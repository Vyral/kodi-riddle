The real estate industry is changing a ton, but some things never change when it comes to buying a home. **Here are five mistakes that will always kill your real estate purchase unless you avoid them:**

**1\. Don’t quit your job.** This may seem very obvious, but it’s worth mentioning. Right before closing, your lender will verify your employment. Even if you’re getting a better job, wait to take it until after your deal is final.

**2\. Don’t purchase or lease a vehicle.** I’ve seen this happen and ruin a home purchase. Even if it’s a small payment or paid for in cash, just don’t do it. Wait until you have your house keys.

**3\. Don’t change your credit card balances.** Avoid buying things like furniture or appliances while you’re in the process of buying a home. It will change your debt-to-income ratio, which will affect your mortgage qualification.

**4\. Don’t spend your down payment money.** If you have money set aside for a down payment, don’t dig into it. Leave it there for closing so that you can fund and close on time.

**5\. Don’t omit liabilities on your loan application.** The lender is going to find out everything, so just be upfront and don’t try to hide anything. If it means you won’t qualify now, that’s ok. We can fix it. However, it will be much harder if you’re not upfront about it.
