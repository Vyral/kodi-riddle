The biggest concern for many people when it comes to buying a home is coming up with the cash for a down payment. If you're in this camp, consider these options.

If you're looking into buying a home in the Phoenix area, the down payment tends to be the biggest obstacle.

A recent survey found that 55% of respondents said they couldn't come up with the cash to qualify for a home loan. The continuing growth of home prices certainly isn't helping. More people are choosing to rent since they feel they don't have the money to buy a home.

Not too long ago, it seemed that anyone with a pulse could get a mortgage, but that's not the case anymore. If you have decent credit and steady income of about two years, though, there are a number of loans you might qualify for:

  **• USDA loan:** This is a zero money down loan with lenient credit requirements that's valid for homes in certain rural and suburban areas.
  **• VA loan:** This is a zero money down option for anyone who has served in the military and has low closing costs and low interest rates.  
  **• FHA loan:** This loan requires 3.5% down, but that's far less than conventional loans.

As you can see, there are plenty of options even if you're in that 55% of people who list the down payment as the No. 1 reason you're not able to buy a home.

If you have any other questions about financing options or buying a home here in the Phoenix area, give me a call or send me an email soon. I'd be more than happy to help.
