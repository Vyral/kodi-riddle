If you’ve been trying to buy a home recently, you already know that we’re in an absolutely crazy market. It seems like sellers hold all the power, there aren’t enough homes to go around, prices are skyrocketing, and competition is incredibly fierce. Now, everyone’s wondering when this blazing-hot market is going to end, so my goal for today is to share what I think will happen and how it could affect buyers and sellers going forward.
