You are searching for homes on a Realtor’s website when a box pops up asking for your contact information. What happens after you enter it?

<div class="post-cta">
Selling your Greater Phoenix Home? <a href="http://www.searchallproperties.com/propertyvaluation-plus/billriddle/Phoenix-375819" target="_blank">Get a free home value report</a><br>
Buying a Greater Phoenix Home? <a href="http://www.greaterphoenixarearealestate.com/" target="_blank">Search all homes for sale</a>
</div>

When you search for real estate information, you will come across many websites that ask you for your contact information.

My website will ask you for your contact information, which then simply goes to our team. I don’t sell that information or do anything else with it other than call you back to see how we can better serve you.

I get comments on our website all of the time from people who say, “I would like to look at homes without entering my contact information.”

In the spirit of transparency, we are only getting your contact information to see if you need further help.

On the other hand, there are other websites that promise great things only to sell your information down the road.

For example, there is a down payment assistance website that looks very official. It looks like a government website, and it talks about all of this grant money it can get you so that you can purchase a home without a down payment.

That program does exist, we have helped many buyers get into a home like that.

However, if you enter your contact information into that website, they will sell it to any Realtor who wants to pay for it.

When you enter your contact information on our home search website, we will call you to help you find a home. This other website does not connect you with a lender or financial institution to help you get this grant. Instead, they send your information to Realtors across the country who may or may not understand how this program works.

Ultimately, it’s important to find out what will happen to your contact information before you enter it in any website.

If you are looking to buy or sell in any area, go to a Realtor’s website. Find the best of the best. Look for a Realtor who has tons of experience and can answer your questions.

We are here to help you. If you have any questions, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!
