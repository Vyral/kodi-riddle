Today we're going to talk about investor offers and whether you, as a seller, should or shouldn’t consider them. When it comes to investor offers, you will see them say things like **“no commissions paid,” “convenience,” “you set the closing date,” “you will see no showings,”** and a lot of other things that are stressful points for sellers. You can still get all of those things and make the most money possible.

If that's the case, why would anybody sell to an investor? It's simply because they don't understand what's happening. An investor makes their money when they purchase your house, not when they sell. What you're maybe not realizing is what they do after they close on your home. They sell through the multiple listing system, through agents. **They pay commissions and all of a sudden they have an audience of thousands of buyers.** They end up making a whole lot more money.

There is a home in my subdivision that was purchased and sold by an investor for $100,000 more within a month of going on the market. You shouldn't lose out on that money. If you're working with an agent who brings a buyer to you and says to go with that buyer before you ever hit the market, they're doing you a disservice too. Do not go that direction, **get on the MLS, have an audience of thousands, and get the most out of your home.**
