<p style="text-align: center;"><em>If you’re a buyer in our market, you must have your finances in order.</em></p>

What’s the latest news from our real estate market?

Before I answer that question, let me preface it by saying that I have what you’d call a very outgoing personality: I’m loud, happy, and smile a ton. Lately though, with everything that’s going on in the world, I’ve been a little more reserved because I know there are a ton of people out there who are in a tough place. I also don’t want to *not* be a beacon of light for you or anyone else willing to take a few minutes out of their day to watch my videos.&nbsp;

In other words, I understand that many things are going wrong across the globe, but there's good news in the real estate industry, and that's where I shine. **Real estate is in a great place here in Arizona.** Conditions are phenomenal for buyers and sellers, and that’s okay—let there be some good news\!

That being said, if you’re a buyer, there is a lot of preparation you need to go through if you want to get the home you want, and **you need to make sure you have your finances set.**&nbsp;

If you plan on paying cash, that’s great. It also means you’ll need a proof of funds, which is presented in one of two ways. The first is through a letter from your bank, and the other is through an account statement (with the account numbers blacked out) that you present to the seller.&nbsp;

If you’re getting a loan to purchase, you need a perfect pre-qualification letter that checks “yes” in every applicable box. **In our market, sellers have many choices,** so they’ll look at the choice that’s most sound and will get them to a successful closing. If you don’t already have a lender who can help you get pre-qualified, I'd be happy to refer you to a few.

If you have any questions about this topic or there’s anything else I can help you with, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. My team and I are here with you every step of the way. Talk to you soon\!&nbsp;
