Why do I make these videos every two weeks? Here’s my explanation.

Selling your Greater Phoenix Home? Get a free home value report
Buying a Greater Phoenix Home? Search all homes for sale

Why do I send these videos out to you each month? The reason is twofold.

First, I want to bring you my knowledge about real estate. From letting you know how the market is doing right now, to showing how you can use tricks of the trade like a 1031 exchange to maximize your investments, there’s just so much information that we have to share. These videos are a great way to get the information from my brain to yours.

Secondly, we’ve come to find that we haven’t always been top-of-mind with our clients. What that means is that we’re not always the first person our past clients have thought about when it comes to real estate. We want to change this. If you run across a real estate problem, or if someone you like, know, and trust has any real estate needs, I want you to know that I will do a great job for them. I want to make you look good.

We’re out here in the market every day and we hope you continue to like the videos. If you have any questions for me in the meantime or any suggestions on future topics, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I would love to hear from you.
