<p style="text-align: center;"><em>COVID-19 hasn’t gone anywhere, but our market is gaining momentum.</em></p>

Today I’m excited to share the latest COVID-19 situation report to help you better understand how our market has fared since the onset of this pandemic. We just saw our third week in a row with an increased number of homes going under contract\! Though we’re still down 19% since February 23, we’re actually up 32% since April 5. There are no spikes in reports of escrow fallouts, which is always great news\! Our sales volume is suffering due to a 39% drop in contract activity within the first six weeks of the stock market crash, but it will rebound with the last three weeks of increases in new contracts. To hear my full report, watch the short video above.
