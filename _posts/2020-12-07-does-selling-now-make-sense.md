Here’s why savvy homeowners can’t go wrong with a winter sale in 2020.

We’ve been getting numerous calls into the office and keep hearing the same question:“Should I sell my home now?” It’s such an easy answer because of where the real estate market is these days. Right now, it’s in favor of sellers and helping them in so many ways, so the answer is a resounding “Yes\!”

**Interest rates are insanely low**, which is keeping demand from buyers very strong. These buyers want to lock in low rates and become homeowners.

The low inventory I mentioned above also plays a critical role. Inventory for entry-level and single-family homes is at an all-time low. If you own one of these homes and are ready to move up into something bigger, it couldn’t be a better time for you to sell.

If you’re out there looking to buy, we understand the struggles you’re probably experiencing right now. However, we have found ourselves to be very well-equipped in getting our buyers into homes in multiple-offer scenarios. Even if you have a home you need to sell before you buy, **we can help you out with a no-hassle cash offer**, which will make a simultaneous close that much easier. There are plenty of other solutions we can come up with in a situation like this.

If you have questions for us about the benefits of today’s market for home sellers or anything else related to real estate, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.
