This is your invitation to the special movie event we’re hosting on April 17 at 2 p.m. **We’d love for you to join us.** We want to thank our family, friends, and past clients for trusting us with their real estate needs, and we want to get back out into the world again. Please join us at the Desert Ridge AMC theater for a showing of “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off.”&nbsp;

We’ll be following AMC theater’s COVID-19 health and safety rules. Popcorn and drinks are included, so email us at [movie@theriddlegroup.com](mailto:movie@theriddlegroup.com)&nbsp;or call (480) 448-2238 to RSVP, and let us know who you are and how many people will be joining you so we can make sure we have enough seats and snacks for everyone. Let’s get back to the movies\!

**Bonus:** At 1:45 in the video above, you can watch a funny blooper reel of me trying to make this video\!&nbsp;

If you have questions about this event or any real estate matter, please call or email us. We would love to be your real estate resource.
