Despite what some may think, an as-is contract doesn’t negate the possibility of repairs. This common, but often misunderstood, kind of contract simply stipulates that the seller won’t remedy issues that aren’t consequential to a home’s structural or mechanical integrity.&nbsp;

**Just like any other deal, buyers may choose to back out with no consequence if the inspection results aren’t to their liking.** Alternatively, they still have the option to request reasonable repairs. If the faucets don’t work, if the air conditioning unit is broken, or if there is some other significant defect with the home, the buyer is still within their rights to ask that these things be fixed—even in an as-is contract.

Any residential resale home will come with some minor wear and tear. In an as-is contract, this kind of everyday damage won’t be remedied by the seller. Instead, the seller will usually factor in the property’s current condition in the way they price and market the home.&nbsp;

Ultimately, **as-is contracts allow sellers to move quickly and buyers to secure a good deal without spending any time negotiating over scuff marks or out-of-date cabinetry.** After all, excessive repair requests can easily sink a deal. In today’s market, it simply doesn’t make sense to walk away from a transaction over something as minor as a shower with low water pressure.&nbsp;
