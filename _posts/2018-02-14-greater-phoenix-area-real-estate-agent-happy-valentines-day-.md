You all have made my Valentine’s Day! We recently sent out a small token of appreciation, and the outpouring of love and thanks in return has been incredible.

You should have all received your Valentine’s Day card from Riddle Realty, along with your delicious brownies.

I am just so grateful to all of you because we have received a huge outpouring of love back. We sent these out to our family, friends, and clients that have supported us over the years as a little token to say hello, and you all have made it bigger than anything.

We are getting messages on Facebook and our email is blowing up with thank yous, and it is such a wonderful feeling. You all have made my Valentine’s Day—thank you so much! I hope you have a wonderful day as well.
