Get a free home value reportBuying a Greater Phoenix Home? Search all homes for saleOne question that seems to be on everyoneâs mind lately is, âAre we in a bubble?â In my opinion, no, I donât believe we are.A bubble, by definition, is what happens when favorable market conditions are nearing an abrupt end. So while our market is at a high point, this alone does not indicate a bubble.In fact, real estate activity is projected to slow as we progress into 2019. This kind of gradual adjustment points to a market shiftânot a bursting market bubble.âOUR MARKET STILL HOLDS AMAZING OPPORTUNITIES FOR BUYERS AND SELLERS ALIKE.âThe current state of interest rates definitely supports this. While rates have been on an upward trend, going up three times in 2018 and set to rise again this year, they are still historically low.In addition to this, other market statistics also reflect signs of good things to come. Homes are appreciating more slowly and taking longer to sell, and inventory is on the rise. Each of these developments indicate a slow shift in favor of buyers.Overall, our market still holds amazing opportunities for buyers and sellers alike.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.",

Search all homes for saleWhy do I send these videos out to you each month? The reason is twofold.First, I want to bring you my knowledge about real estate. From letting you know how the market is doing right now, to showing how you can use tricks of the trade like a 1031 exchange to maximize your investments, thereâs just so much information that we have to share. These videos are a great way to get the information from my brain to yours.âI ALWAYS WANT TO MAKE YOU LOOK GOOD.âSecondly, weâve come to find that we havenât always been top-of-mind with our clients. What that means is that weâre not always the first person our past clients have thought about when it comes to real estate. We want to change this. If you run across a real estate problem, or if someone you like, know, and trust has any real estate needs, I want you to know that I will do a great job for them. I want to make you look good.Weâre out here in the market every day and we hope you continue to like the videos.

        "content": "The average mortgage rate is at a seven-year high. Is this whatâs behind the shift weâre seeing in the market?Selling your Greater Phoenix Home? Get a free home value reportBuying a Greater Phoenix Home? Search all homes for saleThe 30-year fixed mortgage rate currently stands at around 4.77%. Thatâs near a seven-year high, and almost 1% higher than just a year ago. This is the result of a steady rise starting last September and ending this May.What impact is this having on the real estate market? Itâs certainly true that affordability is down. In fact, one estimate from June found that home affordability is at a 10-year low. This is translating into fewer home sales, fewer viewings, and fewer mortgage applications.However, I donât believe that the shifts in the mortgage rate is the primary mover of the changes weâre seeing in the real estate market. In fact, even at its current level, the mortgage rate is still historically low.Instead, the big reason for the changes in the real estate market is the ongoing growth in prices. Over the past several years, home prices have gone up at close to twice the rate of inflation, and have far outstripped the growth of incomes.âOVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, HOME PRICES HAVE INCREASED AT TWICE THE RATE OF INFLATION.âThe price increases, in turn, have been caused by a lack of inventory, which has been shrinking for the past three years. In my opinion, itâs this lack of inventory (and the resulting hike in prices) that explains most of the effects on the real estate market that I listed above.If youâre looking to sell, you should still have no trouble doing so. Demand continues to outstrip supply, and even with dropping affordability, itâs very likely that you would find a buyer quickly and at a top price.If youâre looking to buy, the picture is more complex, because itâs so hard to predict what the mortgage rate might do in the near term. One thing we do know is that the severe lack of inventory is unlikely to change any time soon.As always, if you have questions about the Greater Phoenix real estate market, whether youâre buying or selling, you can give me a call or send me an email.

Get a free home value reportBuying a Greater Phoenix Home? Search all homes for saleAfter several years of continuous price gains, the real estate market seems to be reaching its price cap. In June, the last month for which we have complete numbers, 14% of all listings saw a price cut. Thatâs up from a low of 11.7% at the end of 2016.In the same month, housing demand fell 9.6%, the largest decline in over two years. Mortgage applications to purchase a home have decreased as well.A few things are at play here. One is rising mortgage rates, which have been steadily climbing for much of this year. Another is an overall decrease in affordability, resulting from a combination of the growth in home prices and mortgage rates.If this is the start of a buyerâs market, itâs unlikely to be just a momentary blip. One sign of this is that homebuilder sentiment has recently fallen to the lowest point in almost a year. In other words, homebuilders are losing confidence in their business due to the mentioned affordability concerns.âTHIS IS CERTAINLY GOOD NEWS IF YOUâRE LOOKING TO BUY A HOME.âSo, what does this mean for you?Well, itâs certainly good news if youâre looking to buy, because it means you will have more choice at more affordable prices.On the other hand, if youâve been thinking of selling, this might mean that itâs time to act. Listing your home now would give you the best odds of achieving a top price before the change in the market occurs.Remember that all real estate is local. There are big differences even within the Greater Phoenix area, and prices can change from block to block.If you want more specific information about the Greater Phoenix market, or youâre mulling over the idea of buying or selling a home, give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "As a home seller, there are eight key questions you should ask a Realtor before hiring them.Selling your Greater Phoenix Home? Get a free home value reportBuying a Greater Phoenix Home? Search all homes for saleIf youâre selling your home and youâre interviewing a Realtor to represent you, here are eight questions you need to ask them before hiring them:1. âHow much experience do you have?â By âexperience,â I mean how many transactions theyâve worked from beginning to endânot how many years theyâve been in the business. Iâve met plenty of agents who brag about being in the business for 30 years but only sell two or three homes a year. Thatâs not the same as someone whoâs relatively new to the business but still sells 90 homes per year.2. âWhat do your sales numbers look like?â The key here is not to ask about their list-to-sale price ratio, as that can be skewed in a market like ours where multiple offer situations are common. Rather, you should ask about how many homes theyâve listed and how many of those homes sold.3. âWhat specifically are you going to do for me?â Other than putting a sign in your yard and entering your home into the MLS, what else will they do for you? Whatâs their monthly marketing budget? What does their buyer acquisition plan look like? The answers to these questions are a tell-tale sign of what your agent has in store for you.âTHESE QUESTIONS WILL HELP YOU WHEN YOU INTERVIEW YOUR NEXT REALTOR.â4. âDo you have references?â It doesnât hurt to ask about an agentâs previous clients and how they fared working with them.5. âWhat is your cancellation guarantee?â Do they even have a cancellation guarantee that allows you to cancel your contract if you want? This is another tell-tale sign of whether an agent is confident in their ability to get your home sold and put their money where their mouth is.6. âHow much do you charge?â This is very important for obvious reasons.7. âAre you part of a team or are you an individual agent?â Some sellers prefer to work with the same person from the beginning of the transaction all the way to the end, while others just want to work with the best person for each situation. This question will help you understand what will happen during the process so you can set your expectations accordingly.8. âHow did you arrive at the suggested listed price?â An agent will suggest a list price for your home, and they should have an explanation as to how they came up with that price.If you have any more questions about what to ask an agent before hiring them or you have any other real estate needs, donât hesitate to reach out to me.

        "author": "Vyral Admin",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Being protected in todayâs digital age is incredibly important. Today, I want to go over some of the ways you can prevent a particularly insidious scam which often targets buyers in real estate: wire fraud.Selling your Greater Phoenix Home? Get a free home value reportBuying a Greater Phoenix Home? Search all homes for saleToday I would like to bring you some information about a particularly insidious scam. Iâm talking about wire fraud, and it particularly pertains to the environment of buying and selling a home.Wire fraud is something I hope you never have to experience. Nevertheless, itâs incredibly important to be informed. Wire fraud occurs when a home is close to closing and the buyer needs to wire funds to a title company.Hackers will send a fake email to a buyer, giving them instructions to wire funds to a different account. Once the money is sent, there is no way to get it back.Rarely does a seller ever have to send funds via wiring, but it does happen. This could affect either party in a transaction. Even if the seller is not the one being scammed, they will still be affected if the buyer is left unable to close as a result of wire fraud.There are a few different ways you can identify and avoid this scam:1. Use encrypting. If you are sending any personal information, send it through encrypting. If you donât know how to do this, feel free to reach out and let us help.2. Confirm the wiring instructions are correct. Before you send the money, you can simply give a phone call to the title company. Donât use the phone number on the scam email, though. Use a phone number you receive directly from an agent.3. Clean your emails out regularly. This will prevent any hackers from noticing habits you may have and learning information about you. It could even prevent hackers from knowing youâre buying or selling a home at all.âONCE THE MONEY IS SENT TO A HACKER IN A WIRE FRAUD SCAM, THERE IS NO WAY TO GET IT BACK.â4. Change usernames and passwords regularly. Using the same information across multiple platforms and for long periods of time can hurt your security.5. Never click links in suspicious emails. These links can take you to dangerous websites, cause viruses, or give hackers access to your information.6. Donât conduct business on unsecured Wi-Fi networks. Hotels, coffee shops, and restaurants arenât secure places to do business.7. Trust your instincts. If you see something that is off, donât trust it. As an example, there was an email that was once sent to a buyer with a history of emails. It looked as if there had been a string of emails over a series of days, all to make the message look more authentic. Emails like these can even appear to be coming from your agent.8. Implement up-to-date virus protection. Having anti-virus software will be critical. Itâs much better to be safe than sorry.9. Make sure all parties have security measures in place. You arenât the only party who needs to be protected in order for your information and money to stay safe. Donât send any personal information like your social security number to your agent. They donât need it, and this would be a massive red flag.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "title": "Should You Work With an Agent When Buying New Construction? ",
        "author": "Vyral Admin",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Why should you hire a real estate agent to buy a new construction home? There are many reasons, but the main one is that the builderâs agent will not protect your best interests.Selling your Greater Phoenix Home? Get a free home value reportBuying a Greater Phoenix Home? Search all homes for saleIf you are interested in buying a new construction home, should you work with a real estate agent?Builders like Richmond American or Taylor Morrison will have an office you can walk into and model homes for you to look at. Do you need an agent with you when you walk through the door? Yes, and there are a few reasons why.The agent you meet at the builderâs site is there to represent the builder. They are all wonderful people who are great at their job, but the bottom line is they are not there to protect your best interests. You need someone there with you to represent you.If you want to look at model homes and you walk into the office without an agent, they will ask you to sign a form. If you sign with the builder and decide that you would like to buy from them, it is now too late to bring your real estate agent into the transaction. You already signed without them on that first visit.To avoid this issue, make sure your agent goes with you. Your agent can sign you in. If you decide not to buy from that builder, then thereâs no problem. If you do decide to purchase from that builder, your agent will be able to represent you.Another thing to keep in mind is that the builder has pre-approved lenders who offer great incentives to work with them. Itâs no secret that the builder and the lender are a team, and you can get fantastic incentives. However, if you have your own agent, they may know other lenders that could be a better choice than the one recommended by the builder.The contract with the builder is completely designed to protect the builder and their interest. Thatâs okay, but it is important to have someone there to tell you the black-and-white of that contract, not the spun version the builder will present. If you listen to the builder and you decide to cancel the deal after youâve signed the dotted line, there is a very good chance that you will lose your earnest money.âTHE BUILDERâS AGENT IS THERE TO PROTECT THE BUILDERâS BEST INTERESTS, NOT YOURS.âWhen it comes to taxes, the builder will quote taxes on the unimproved land. To get an idea of what your property taxes will be once the home is built, your agent will do some research to figure out what your tax bill will be 12 or 24 months from now.The public report is a critical piece of this transaction. Iâve seen clients walk in ready to sign a contract that says, âYou have read the public report.â The builder agent may say, âThis just shows that I gave you a copy of the report.âDonât fall for this; the contract says that you have read through the public report. Itâs a very important document that you need to read.I also recommend that you walk your lot to see if it will be a good fit for you when all of those other homes are built down the road. Things may be wide open now, but your agent can help you make sure that the lot will work for you in the future as well.As your real estate agent, we are there to protect you and your investment. You may not plan on selling this new home for another 20 years, but we can still give you a little advice when it comes to resale value. You never knowâyou may need to move sooner than you think. When itâs time to choose your cabinets and countertops, your agent can help you increase your resale value so that your home will be adored by prospective buyers in the future.Those are just a few main reasons you should absolutely work with a real estate agent when buying a new construction home. If you have any other questions about this process, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!",

        "author": "Vyral Admin",
        "category": "",
        "content": "The Fedâs recent rate hike shouldnât have any significant impact on our Phoenix market. In fact, it might actually stimulate it.Selling your Greater Phoenix Home? Get a free home value reportBuying a Greater Phoenix Home? Search all homes for saleOn June 14th, the Federal Reserve increased its federal funds interest rate by 0.25%. Theyâre also widely expected to raise rates once or twice more over the course of 2017. What does this mean for the real estate market?While any action by the Fed always garners a lot of attention and everyone starts to go crazy, I believe these increases will not have any significant impact on our market. There are three reasons why.First of all, mortgage rates have actually trended lower in the wake of the Fedâs recent announcement. The 30-year mortgage rate recently hit 3.9%, the lowest level in 2017. In fact, itâs a common pattern for the mortgage rate and the Fed rate to move in opposite directions, and the same thing has happened the last two times the Fed raised rates.Second, the economy continues to do well. The Fed decided to increase its rate because unemployment and inflation are low, household spending is picking up, and weâve seen steady growth for the past nine years. This is good news for the real estate market. As expected, we continue to see strong demand and a corresponding increase in home prices.Third, while the Fedâs rate increase is usually meant to cool off the economy, it might actually be having the opposite effect it in this case. Because interest rates were so low for such a long period of time, experts believe the recent increases might ease pressure on the financial system and encourage increased lending.Case in point: since the Fed started raising its rate in December 2016, total mortgages are up 2.5% year over year.In conclusion, while any move by the Fed is likely to lead to a lot of hand-wringing, I believe the real estate market will not be affected and will continue on its own healthy course. We still have a balanced market, especially above the $300,000 range.Nonetheless, itâs clear that right now is a uniquely good moment for everyone in the real estate market. Todayâs low mortgage rates are good for homebuyers because they make homes more affordable.If you have any questions about our market or youâre thinking of buying or selling a home, give me a call or send me an email.

More people are choosing to rent since they feel they donât have the money to buy a home.Not too long ago, it seemed that anyone with a pulse could get a mortgage, but thatâs not the case anymore.

Get a free home value reportBuying a Greater Phoenix Home? Search all homes for saleWhat can you do if you change your mind after youâve signed a purchase agreement on a home?As a buyer, there are so many loopholes in the Arizona purchase agreement. For example, you have a 10-day inspection period. If you know for sure that you donât want to buy a particular home, something will come up in the inspection that will allow you to get out of that contract.You could also find an issue with the sellerâs disclosure form, the HOA guidelines, the codes and restrictions for the area, etc. If you want out of that contract, you are covered. Fear not!As a seller, all bets are off. If you are a seller and you have signed a purchase agreement to sell your home, you are bound to that purchase agreement. The buyer might request some things such as repairs, in which case you can refuse to comply and hope the buyer walks away from the sale. However, if you feel in any way that you may not want to sell your home, tell your agent.âIF YOUâRE A BUYER AND WANT OUT OF A PURCHASE AGREEMENT, FEAR NOT!âItâs much harder for a seller to get out of a purchase contract, so you need to be sure you want to sell before itâs signed.In fact, I am working with a buyer right now in a case where the seller has changed their mind. The buyer now has an attorney, I have an attorney, the seller has an attorney, the sellerâs agent has an attorney, and it is a complete mess. The seller is in hot water because she has a contractual obligation to sell her home, and itâs going to cost her a lot of money to keep it.At the end of the day, this is your biggest investment, so make sure you are open and honest with the professional you have chosen to represent you.If you have any other questions about this topic of youâre thinking about buying or selling a home, give me a call or send me an email.
