One question that seems to be on everyone’s mind lately is, “Are we in a bubble?” In my opinion, no, I don’t believe we are.

A bubble, by definition, is what happens when favorable market conditions are nearing an abrupt end. So while our market is at a high point, this alone does not indicate a bubble.

In fact, real estate activity is projected to slow as we progress into 2019. This kind of gradual adjustment points to a market shift—not a bursting market bubble.

“OUR MARKET STILL HOLDS AMAZING OPPORTUNITIES FOR BUYERS AND SELLERS ALIKE.”

The current state of interest rates definitely supports this. While rates have been on an upward trend, going up three times in 2018 and set to rise again this year, they are still historically low.

In addition to this, other market statistics also reflect signs of good things to come. Homes are appreciating more slowly and taking longer to sell, and inventory is on the rise. Each of these developments indicate a slow shift in favor of buyers.

Overall, our market still holds amazing opportunities for buyers and sellers alike.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

        <description>

Why do I make these videos every two weeks? Here’s my explanation.


Selling your Greater Phoenix Home? Get a free home value report
Buying a Greater Phoenix Home? Search all homes for sale


Why do I send these videos out to you each month? The reason is twofold.

First, I want to bring you my knowledge about real estate. From letting you know how the market is doing right now, to showing how you can use tricks of the trade like a 1031 exchange to maximize your investments, there’s just so much information that we have to share. These videos are a great way to get the information from my brain to yours.

“I ALWAYS WANT TO MAKE YOU LOOK GOOD.”

Secondly, we’ve come to find that we haven’t always been top-of-mind with our clients. What that means is that we’re not always the first person our past clients have thought about when it comes to real estate. We want to change this. If you run across a real estate problem, or if someone you like, know, and trust has any real estate needs, I want you to know that I will do a great job for them. I want to make you look good.

We’re out here in the market every day and we hope you continue to like the videos. If you have any questions for me in the meantime or any suggestions on future topics, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I would love to hear from you.

The average mortgage rate is at a seven-year high. Is this what’s behind the shift we’re seeing in the market?

The 30-year fixed mortgage rate currently stands at around 4.77%. That’s near a seven-year high, and almost 1% higher than just a year ago. This is the result of a steady rise starting last September and ending this May.

What impact is this having on the real estate market? It’s certainly true that affordability is down. In fact, one estimate from June found that home affordability is at a 10-year low. This is translating into fewer home sales, fewer viewings, and fewer mortgage applications.

However, I don’t believe that the shifts in the mortgage rate is the primary mover of the changes we’re seeing in the real estate market. In fact, even at its current level, the mortgage rate is still historically low.

Instead, the big reason for the changes in the real estate market is the ongoing growth in prices. Over the past several years, home prices have gone up at close to twice the rate of inflation, and have far outstripped the growth of incomes.

“OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, HOME PRICES HAVE INCREASED AT TWICE THE RATE OF INFLATION.”

The price increases, in turn, have been caused by a lack of inventory, which has been shrinking for the past three years. In my opinion, it’s this lack of inventory (and the resulting hike in prices) that explains most of the effects on the real estate market that I listed above.

If you’re looking to sell, you should still have no trouble doing so. Demand continues to outstrip supply, and even with dropping affordability, it’s very likely that you would find a buyer quickly and at a top price.

If you’re looking to buy, the picture is more complex, because it’s so hard to predict what the mortgage rate might do in the near term. One thing we do know is that the severe lack of inventory is unlikely to change any time soon.

As always, if you have questions about the Greater Phoenix real estate market, whether you’re buying or selling, you can give me a call or send me an email. I’m here to help.

After being in a seller’s market for quite some time now, it looks like a shift is on the horizon. Here’s what you can expect.

After several years of continuous price gains, the real estate market seems to be reaching its price cap. In June, the last month for which we have complete numbers, 14% of all listings saw a price cut. That’s up from a low of 11.7% at the end of 2016.

In the same month, housing demand fell 9.6%, the largest decline in over two years. Mortgage applications to purchase a home have decreased as well.

A few things are at play here. One is rising mortgage rates, which have been steadily climbing for much of this year. Another is an overall decrease in affordability, resulting from a combination of the growth in home prices and mortgage rates.

If this is the start of a buyer’s market, it’s unlikely to be just a momentary blip. One sign of this is that homebuilder sentiment has recently fallen to the lowest point in almost a year. In other words, homebuilders are losing confidence in their business due to the mentioned affordability concerns.

“THIS IS CERTAINLY GOOD NEWS IF YOU’RE LOOKING TO BUY A HOME.”

So, what does this mean for you?

Well, it’s certainly good news if you’re looking to buy, because it means you will have more choice at more affordable prices.

On the other hand, if you’ve been thinking of selling, this might mean that it’s time to act. Listing your home now would give you the best odds of achieving a top price before the change in the market occurs.

Remember that all real estate is local. There are big differences even within the Greater Phoenix area, and prices can change from block to block.

If you want more specific information about the Greater Phoenix market, or you’re mulling over the idea of buying or selling a home, give me a call or send me an email. I’m here to help.

As a home seller, there are eight key questions you should ask a Realtor before hiring them.


Selling your Greater Phoenix Home? Get a free home value report
Buying a Greater Phoenix Home? Search all homes for sale


If you’re selling your home and you’re interviewing a Realtor to represent you, here are eight questions you need to ask them before hiring them:

1. “How much experience do you have?” By “experience,” I mean how many transactions they’ve worked from beginning to end—not how many years they’ve been in the business. I’ve met plenty of agents who brag about being in the business for 30 years but only sell two or three homes a year. That’s not the same as someone who’s relatively new to the business but still sells 90 homes per year.

2. “What do your sales numbers look like?” The key here is not to ask about their list-to-sale price ratio, as that can be skewed in a market like ours where multiple offer situations are common. Rather, you should ask about how many homes they’ve listed and how many of those homes sold.

3. “What specifically are you going to do for me?” Other than putting a sign in your yard and entering your home into the MLS, what else will they do for you? What’s their monthly marketing budget? What does their buyer acquisition plan look like? The answers to these questions are a tell-tale sign of what your agent has in store for you.

“THESE QUESTIONS WILL HELP YOU WHEN YOU INTERVIEW YOUR NEXT REALTOR.”

4. “Do you have references?” It doesn’t hurt to ask about an agent’s previous clients and how they fared working with them.

5. “What is your cancellation guarantee?” Do they even have a cancellation guarantee that allows you to cancel your contract if you want? This is another tell-tale sign of whether an agent is confident in their ability to get your home sold and put their money where their mouth is.

6. “How much do you charge?” This is very important for obvious reasons.

7. “Are you part of a team or are you an individual agent?” Some sellers prefer to work with the same person from the beginning of the transaction all the way to the end, while others just want to work with the best person for each situation. This question will help you understand what will happen during the process so you can set your expectations accordingly.

8. “How did you arrive at the suggested listed price?” An agent will suggest a list price for your home, and they should have an explanation as to how they came up with that price.

If you have any more questions about what to ask an agent before hiring them or you have any other real estate needs, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.

You are searching for homes on a Realtor’s website when a box pops up asking for your contact information. What happens after you enter it?

When you search for real estate information, you will come across many websites that ask you for your contact information.

My website will ask you for your contact information, which then simply goes to our team. I don’t sell that information or do anything else with it other than call you back to see how we can better serve you.

I get comments on our website all of the time from people who say, “I would like to look at homes without entering my contact information.”

In the spirit of transparency, we are only getting your contact information to see if you need further help.

On the other hand, there are other websites that promise great things only to sell your information down the road.

For example, there is a down payment assistance website that looks very official. It looks like a government website, and it talks about all of this grant money it can get you so that you can purchase a home without a down payment.

“WE WILL NEVER SELL YOUR INFORMATION TO ANYONE.”

That program does exist, we have helped many buyers get into a home like that.

However, if you enter your contact information into that website, they will sell it to any Realtor who wants to pay for it.

When you enter your contact information on our home search website, we will call you to help you find a home. This other website does not connect you with a lender or financial institution to help you get this grant. Instead, they send your information to Realtors across the country who may or may not understand how this program works.

Ultimately, it’s important to find out what will happen to your contact information before you enter it in any website.

If you are looking to buy or sell in any area, go to a Realtor’s website. Find the best of the best. Look for a Realtor who has tons of experience and can answer your questions.

We are here to help you. If you have any questions, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!

Being protected in today’s digital age is incredibly important. Today, I want to go over some of the ways you can prevent a particularly insidious scam which often targets buyers in real estate: wire fraud.


Selling your Greater Phoenix Home? Get a free home value report

Today I would like to bring you some information about a particularly insidious scam. I’m talking about wire fraud, and it particularly pertains to the environment of buying and selling a home.

Wire fraud is something I hope you never have to experience. Nevertheless, it’s incredibly important to be informed. Wire fraud occurs when a home is close to closing and the buyer needs to wire funds to a title company.

Hackers will send a fake email to a buyer, giving them instructions to wire funds to a different account. Once the money is sent, there is no way to get it back.

Rarely does a seller ever have to send funds via wiring, but it does happen. This could affect either party in a transaction. Even if the seller is not the one being scammed, they will still be affected if the buyer is left unable to close as a result of wire fraud.

There are a few different ways you can identify and avoid this scam:

1. Use encrypting. If you are sending any personal information, send it through encrypting. If you don’t know how to do this, feel free to reach out and let us help.

2. Confirm the wiring instructions are correct. Before you send the money, you can simply give a phone call to the title company. Don’t use the phone number on the scam email, though. Use a phone number you receive directly from an agent.

3. Clean your emails out regularly. This will prevent any hackers from noticing habits you may have and learning information about you. It could even prevent hackers from knowing you’re buying or selling a home at all.

“ONCE THE MONEY IS SENT TO A HACKER IN A WIRE FRAUD SCAM, THERE IS NO WAY TO GET IT BACK.”

4. Change usernames and passwords regularly. Using the same information across multiple platforms and for long periods of time can hurt your security.

5. Never click links in suspicious emails. These links can take you to dangerous websites, cause viruses, or give hackers access to your information.

6. Don’t conduct business on unsecured Wi-Fi networks. Hotels, coffee shops, and restaurants aren’t secure places to do business.

7. Trust your instincts. If you see something that is off, don’t trust it. As an example, there was an email that was once sent to a buyer with a history of emails. It looked as if there had been a string of emails over a series of days, all to make the message look more authentic. Emails like these can even appear to be coming from your agent.

8. Implement up-to-date virus protection. Having anti-virus software will be critical. It’s much better to be safe than sorry.

9. Make sure all parties have security measures in place. You aren’t the only party who needs to be protected in order for your information and money to stay safe. Don’t send any personal information like your social security number to your agent. They don’t need it, and this would be a massive red flag.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Why should you hire a real estate agent to buy a new construction home? There are many reasons, but the main one is that the builder’s agent will not protect your best interests.

If you are interested in buying a new construction home, should you work with a real estate agent?

Builders like Richmond American or Taylor Morrison will have an office you can walk into and model homes for you to look at. Do you need an agent with you when you walk through the door? Yes, and there are a few reasons why.

The agent you meet at the builder’s site is there to represent the builder. They are all wonderful people who are great at their job, but the bottom line is they are not there to protect your best interests. You need someone there with you to represent you.

If you want to look at model homes and you walk into the office without an agent, they will ask you to sign a form. If you sign with the builder and decide that you would like to buy from them, it is now too late to bring your real estate agent into the transaction. You already signed without them on that first visit.

To avoid this issue, make sure your agent goes with you. Your agent can sign you in. If you decide not to buy from that builder, then there’s no problem. If you do decide to purchase from that builder, your agent will be able to represent you.

Another thing to keep in mind is that the builder has pre-approved lenders who offer great incentives to work with them. It’s no secret that the builder and the lender are a team, and you can get fantastic incentives. However, if you have your own agent, they may know other lenders that could be a better choice than the one recommended by the builder.

The contract with the builder is completely designed to protect the builder and their interest. That’s okay, but it is important to have someone there to tell you the black-and-white of that contract, not the spun version the builder will present. If you listen to the builder and you decide to cancel the deal after you’ve signed the dotted line, there is a very good chance that you will lose your earnest money.

“THE BUILDER’S AGENT IS THERE TO PROTECT THE BUILDER’S BEST INTERESTS, NOT YOURS.”

When it comes to taxes, the builder will quote taxes on the unimproved land. To get an idea of what your property taxes will be once the home is built, your agent will do some research to figure out what your tax bill will be 12 or 24 months from now.

The public report is a critical piece of this transaction. I’ve seen clients walk in ready to sign a contract that says, “You have read the public report.” The builder agent may say, “This just shows that I gave you a copy of the report.”

Don’t fall for this; the contract says that you have read through the public report. It’s a very important document that you need to read.

I also recommend that you walk your lot to see if it will be a good fit for you when all of those other homes are built down the road. Things may be wide open now, but your agent can help you make sure that the lot will work for you in the future as well.

As your real estate agent, we are there to protect you and your investment. You may not plan on selling this new home for another 20 years, but we can still give you a little advice when it comes to resale value. You never know—you may need to move sooner than you think. When it’s time to choose your cabinets and countertops, your agent can help you increase your resale value so that your home will be adored by prospective buyers in the future.

Those are just a few main reasons you should absolutely work with a real estate agent when buying a new construction home. If you have any other questions about this process, just give me a call or send me an email. I would be happy to help you!

        <title>What Does the Feds Recent Rate Hike Mean for the Real Estate Market? </title>

The Fed’s recent rate hike shouldn’t have any significant impact on our Phoenix market. In fact, it might actually stimulate it.

On June 14th, the Federal Reserve increased its federal funds interest rate by 0.25%. They’re also widely expected to raise rates once or twice more over the course of 2017. What does this mean for the real estate market?

While any action by the Fed always garners a lot of attention and everyone starts to go crazy, I believe these increases will not have any significant impact on our market. There are three reasons why.

First of all, mortgage rates have actually trended lower in the wake of the Fed’s recent announcement. The 30-year mortgage rate recently hit 3.9%, the lowest level in 2017. In fact, it’s a common pattern for the mortgage rate and the Fed rate to move in opposite directions, and the same thing has happened the last two times the Fed raised rates.

Second, the economy continues to do well. The Fed decided to increase its rate because unemployment and inflation are low, household spending is picking up, and we’ve seen steady growth for the past nine years. This is good news for the real estate market. As expected, we continue to see strong demand and a corresponding increase in home prices.

Third, while the Fed’s rate increase is usually meant to cool off the economy, it might actually be having the opposite effect it in this case. Because interest rates were so low for such a long period of time, experts believe the recent increases might ease pressure on the financial system and encourage increased lending.

Case in point: since the Fed started raising its rate in December 2016, total mortgages are up 2.5% year over year.

In conclusion, while any move by the Fed is likely to lead to a lot of hand-wringing, I believe the real estate market will not be affected and will continue on its own healthy course. We still have a balanced market, especially above the $300,000 range.

Nonetheless, it’s clear that right now is a uniquely good moment for everyone in the real estate market. Today’s low mortgage rates are good for homebuyers because they make homes more affordable.

If you have any questions about our market or you’re thinking of buying or selling a home, give me a call or send me an email. I’d love to help.

        <description>

The biggest concern for many people when it comes to buying a home is coming up with the cash for a down payment. If you’re in this camp, consider these options.


Selling your Greater Phoenix Home? Get a free home value report
Buying a Greater Phoenix Home? Search all homes for sale


If you’re looking into buying a home in the Phoenix area, the down payment tends to be the biggest obstacle.

A recent survey found that 55% of respondents said they couldn’t come up with the cash to qualify for a home loan. The continuing growth of home prices certainly isn’t helping. More people are choosing to rent since they feel they don’t have the money to buy a home.

Not too long ago, it seemed that anyone with a pulse could get a mortgage, but that’s not the case anymore. If you have decent credit and steady income of about two years, though, there are a number of loans you might qualify for:

• USDA loan: This is a zero money down loan with lenient credit requirements that’s valid for homes in certain rural and suburban areas.
  • VA loan: This is a zero money down option for anyone who has served in the military and has low closing costs and low interest rates.
  • FHA loan: This loan requires 3.5% down, but that’s far less than conventional loans.

“WITH DECENT CREDIT AND STEADY INCOME, THERE ARE MANY LOANS YOU MIGHT QUALIFY FOR.”

As you can see, there are plenty of options even if you’re in that 55% of people who list the down payment as the No. 1 reason you’re not able to buy a home.

If you have any other questions about financing options or buying a home here in the Phoenix area, give me a call or send me an email soon. I’d be more than happy to help.

        <description>

Today I want to go over what your options are as a buyer and as a seller if you change your mind after signing a purchase agreement.


Selling your Greater Phoenix Home? Get a free home value report
Buying a Greater Phoenix Home? Search all homes for sale


What can you do if you change your mind after you’ve signed a purchase agreement on a home?

As a buyer, there are so many loopholes in the Arizona purchase agreement. For example, you have a 10-day inspection period. If you know for sure that you don’t want to buy a particular home, something will come up in the inspection that will allow you to get out of that contract.

You could also find an issue with the seller’s disclosure form, the HOA guidelines, the codes and restrictions for the area, etc. If you want out of that contract, you are covered. Fear not!

As a seller, all bets are off. If you are a seller and you have signed a purchase agreement to sell your home, you are bound to that purchase agreement. The buyer might request some things such as repairs, in which case you can refuse to comply and hope the buyer walks away from the sale. However, if you feel in any way that you may not want to sell your home, tell your agent.

“IF YOU’RE A BUYER AND WANT OUT OF A PURCHASE AGREEMENT, FEAR NOT!”

It’s much harder for a seller to get out of a purchase contract, so you need to be sure you want to sell before it’s signed.

In fact, I am working with a buyer right now in a case where the seller has changed their mind. The buyer now has an attorney, I have an attorney, the seller has an attorney, the seller’s agent has an attorney, and it is a complete mess. The seller is in hot water because she has a contractual obligation to sell her home, and it’s going to cost her a lot of money to keep it.

At the end of the day, this is your biggest investment, so make sure you are open and honest with the professional you have chosen to represent you.

If you have any other questions about this topic of you’re thinking about buying or selling a home, give me a call or send me an email. I’d be happy to help you.
